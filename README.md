# Chatbot Development

- This chatbot is built using the open-source framework Rasa and is designed to understand and respond to natural language inputs.
- To get started with the chatbot, you will need to have Python and Rasa installed on your machine. Once you have these dependencies set up, you can begin training and testing your chatbot.

Here's an example of how to train and test the chatbot using the provided example files:

- First, navigate to the directory where the example files are located.
- Run the command "rasa train" to train the chatbot using the data in the "data" folder.
- Once the training is complete, run the command "rasa shell" to start the chatbot and interact with it in the command line.
